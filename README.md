AWS DeepRacer gives an interesting and fun way to get started with reinforcement learning (RL). RL is an advanced machine learning (ML) technique that takes a very different approach to training models than other machine learning methods. Its super power is that it learns very complex behaviors without requiring any labeled training data, and can make short term decisions while optimizing for a longer term goal.

Here in this repo i am sharing my progress with the DeepRacer . My Current Rank in August Leaderboard is 300. Though I had a prior knowldge of Machine Learning, The experience made me learn alot from scratch. 
Sharing all the model for the references.
